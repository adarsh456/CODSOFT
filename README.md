This repository contains projects completed as part of the CODSOFT Data Science Internship, covering data analysis, machine learning, and visualization.

Projects

Task 1: [Titanic Survival Prediction] -Titanic dataset to build a model that predicts whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not.

Task 2: [ MOVIE RATING PREDICTION WITH PYTHON] - The model that predicts the rating of a movie based onfeatures like genre, director, and actors.

Task 3: [IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION] -  The Iris dataset to develop a model that can classify iris flowers into different species based on their sepal and petal measurements. 

Task 4: [ SALES PREDICTION USING PYTHON] -  The Iris dataset to develop a model that can classify iris flowers into different species based on their sepal and petal measurements. 

Task 5:[ SALES PREDICTION USING PYTHON] - The model that predict the future sales based on the past sales data.

Task 5:[CREDIT CARD FRAUD DETECTION] -  The   machine learning model to identify fraudulent credit card transactions. In which Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like precision, recall,
 and F1-score, and consider techniques like oversampling or undersampling for improving results
